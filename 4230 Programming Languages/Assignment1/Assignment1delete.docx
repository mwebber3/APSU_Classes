CSCI 4230 – Assignment 1
1.	Write regular expressions for the following. The alphabet in question consists of a, b, and c.
a.	Strings that start with a followed by zero or more occurrences of b.
Answer: “^ab*”
// side note: I was wondering if something like this would also work? “^a(b)*$”
b.	Strings that start with a followed by zero or more occurrences of either b or c.
Answer: “^a(b|c)*”
c.	Strings that start with a followed by one or more occurrences of b. 
Answer: “^ab+” 	
// side note: would this work? “^a(b)+$”
d.	Strings that have an even number of characters.
Answer: “^\d*[02468]$”
e.	Strings that have an odd number of characters. 
Answer: “^\d*[13579]$”
2.	Write a regular expression for a string literal defined as follows:
-	Starts with a “.
-	Ends with a “.
-	Between these two characters a string literal may contain any number of characters that are not a “ or a \. You can represent such a character with the symbol normal_char, which you do not have to define separately. 
-	In addition, a string literal can contain any of the following escape codes: \n, \”, and \\. 
-	Examples include “”, “Hello”, and “, Hello, World! \n”.

Answer: “(normal_char|\n|\|\\)*”

3.	Write a regular expression for an identifier defined as follows: 
-	Must start with a letter or a _.
-	After the first character, there may be any number of digits, letters, or underscores.
-	Use [0-9] to represent a single digit and [a-zA-Z] to represent a single letter.
-	Examples include x, MyVar, my_var, and my_var3.

Answer: “[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]”

4.	Write a regular expression for a floating-point number defined as follows:
-	A sequence of digits followed by a . followed by a sequence of digits. 
-	The sequence before the . may be empty and can only start with 0 if it is the only digit in the sequence. 
-	The sequence after the . must contain at least one digit. 
-	Examples include 0.5, 3.141592, 256.0, and .142857. 

Answer: “[+-]?([0-9]*[.])?[0-9]+”
